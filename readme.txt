1. Libraries need to be installed:
	-> cv2
	-> numpy
	-> copy
	-> os
	-> scipy.interpolate (import RectBivariateSpline)

2. The " path " has to have the location of the datafiles of the three cases for their respective codes. The path name has to be given at " path " which is written right after importing the libraries in the code.

3. There are 3 codes that have been uploaded for the three cases, i.e. for the human walking, car and vase:
	-> "python3 human.py" - For the tracking of human walking 
	-> "python3 car.py"   - For the car tracking 
	-> "python3 vase.py"  - For the vase tracking
